One of the most used service, to have your Kubernetes cluster deploy in cloud, is the Elastic Kubernetes Service provided by AWS.

EKS (more details [here](https://aws.amazon.com/it/eks/) regarding pricing and general overview) is a managed service that helps make it easier to run Kubernetes on AWS. It is defined as containers-as-a-service (CaaS) that simplifies Kubernetes deployment on AWS. Practically speacking, you do not need to manage the installation of Kubernetes on EC2 instances but you can leave the installation to EKS.
