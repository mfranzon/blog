Hi there! I'm Marco Franzon and this is KubeTips.

I would like to have a place in which share what I find interesting and curious
using frequently Docker and Kubernetes. As I spend mostly of my time writing Python code
and doing DevOps stuff with containers, everyday I face out new bugs or
challenges to solve, sometimes it is fun sometimes it is frustrating,
but always I learn something new.

I think on this website as an "incident playbook" more than a blog. I will tell about
my troubles with Docker, Podman, Singularity, Kubernetes, CRI-O, containerd and
some useful tips or software to use to avoid sleepless nights!
