The main philosophy of this website is to share the knowledge between developers
that have found new solutions for everyday problems.

If you want to tell your "how to", or you think that an article is incomplete or
you can do it better, you are in the right place. Click on [Github](https://github.com/mfranzon/blog) to start.


<ul>
<li>Clone the repo</li>
<li>Add your post in <code>./kubetips/content/posts</code> or modify an existing one.</li>
<li> Posts are written in MarkDown, use this as header in case you are writing a new one:

```
---
title: "Title"
date: {{ .Date }}
draft: true
author : yourname
---
```

<li>If you want to modify an existing one, just add your name in header's authors list</li>
<li>Make a Pull Request</li>
</ul>

And that's all! As soon as possible I will have a look on the new post
and for sure merge your contribution.
