The main philosophy of this website is to share the knowledge between developers
that have found new solutions for everyday problems.

If you want to tell your "how to", or you think that an article is incomplete or
you can do it better, you are in the right place. All the code of this website is
public on [Github](https://github.com/mfranzon/blog).

<ul>
<li>Clone the repo</li>
<li>Add your post in <code>./kubetips/content/posts</code> or modify an existing one.</li>
<li>Remember to add you name in the authors section, at the beginning of the article</li>
<li>Make a Pull Request</li>
</ul>

And that's all! As soon as possible I will have a look on the new post
and for sure merge your contribution.
